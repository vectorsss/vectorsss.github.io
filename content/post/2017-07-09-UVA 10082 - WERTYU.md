**UVA 10082 - WERTYU**  
A common typing error is to place the  
hands on the keyboard one row to the  
right of the correct position. So ‘Q’ is  
typed as ‘W’ and ‘J’ is typed as ‘K’ and  
so on. You are to decode a message typed in this manner.  
**Input**  
Input consists of several lines of text. Each line may contain digits, spaces, upper case letters (except  
Q, A, Z), or punctuation shown above \[except back-quote (‘)\]. Keys labelled with words \[Tab, BackSp,  
Control, etc.\] are not represented in the input.  
**Output**  
You are to replace each letter or punction symbol by the one immediately to its left on the ‘QWERTY’  
keyboard shown above. Spaces in the input should be echoed in the output.  
**Sample Input**  
O S, GOMR YPFSU/  
**Sample Output**  
I AM FINE TODAY.

题目大意：一个程序员打代码的时候手放错了位置,往右偏了一点。所以他输入的代码都是错的。需要帮他纠正过来，只考虑数字和字母。(键盘不包括小键盘)

```
#include  
char s[] = "`1234567890-=QWERTYUIOP[]\\ASDFGHJKL;'ZXCVBNM,./";  
int main() {  
    int i,c; 
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {  
        for (i = 1; s[i]!='\0' && s[i] != c; i++);
        if (c==65||c==81||c==90){}//65 81 90分别为A Q Z的ASCII码值
        else if (s[i]) putchar(s[i - 1]);
        else putchar(c); 
    }
    return 0;  
}
```
