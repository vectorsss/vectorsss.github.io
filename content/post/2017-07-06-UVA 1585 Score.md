There is an objective test result such as “OOXXOXXOOO”. An ‘O’ means a correct answer of a problem  
and an ‘X’ means a wrong answer. The score of each problem of this test is calculated by itself and  
its just previous consecutive ‘O’s only when the answer is correct. For example, the score of the 10th  
problem is 3 that is obtained by itself and its two previous consecutive ‘O’s.  
Therefore, the score of “OOXXOXXOOO” is 10 which is calculated by “1+2+0+0+1+0+0+1+2+3”.  
You are to write a program calculating the scores of test results.  
**Input**  
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test  
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing a string  
composed by ‘O’ and ‘X’ and the length of the string is more than 0 and less than 80. There is no spaces  
between ‘O’ and ‘X’.  
**Output**  
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to  
contain the score of the test case.  
**Sample Input**  
5  
OOXXOXXOOO  
OOXXOOXXOO  
OXOXOXOXOXOXOX  
OOOOOOOOOO  
OOOOXOOOOXOOOOX  
**Sample Output**  
10  
9  
7  
55  
30  
**解题思路：**在一个只有O和X的序列中，X代表0，连续的O代表首项为1公差为1的等差数列，如果被X切断，那么从首项就变成1，重新开始递增。求被X分割的所有等差数列an的和。

```
#include 
#include
#define MAX 80

int main()
{
    /* code */
    int T,num,len; 
    scanf("%d",&T);
    char str[MAX];
    while(T--){
    num=1;
    scanf("%s",str);
    len=strlen(str);
    int sum=0;//定义初始总和为0
    for (int i = 0; i 
```
