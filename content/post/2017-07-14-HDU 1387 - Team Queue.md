Queues and Priority Queues are data structures which are known to most computer scientists. The Team Queue, however, is not so well known, though it occurs often in everyday life. At lunch time the queue in front of the Mensa is a team queue, for example.  
In a team queue each element belongs to a team. If an element enters the queue, it first searches the queue from head to tail to check if some of its teammates (elements of the same team) are already in the queue. If yes, it enters the queue right behind them. If not, it enters the queue at the tail and becomes the new last element (bad luck). Dequeuing is done like in normal queues: elements are processed from head to tail in the order they appear in the team queue.

Your task is to write a program that simulates such a team queue.

**Input**

The input will contain one or more test cases. Each test case begins with the number of teams t (1

Finally, a list of commands follows. There are three different kinds of commands:

ENQUEUE x - enter element x into the team queue  
DEQUEUE - process the first element and remove it from the queue  
STOP - end of test case  
The input will be terminated by a value of 0 for t.

**Output**

For each test case, first print a line saying "Scenario #k", where k is the number of the test case. Then, for each DEQUEUE command, print the element which is dequeued on a single line. Print a blank line after each test case, even after the last one.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

Scenario #1  
101  
102  
103  
201  
202  
203

Scenario #2  
259001  
259002  
259003  
259004  
259005  
260001

**题目大意：**  
给出n个队列，当出现ENQUEUE指令的时候，就将ENQUEUE后面的那个数据加入队伍当中，加入队伍的规则是：如果有同属一个队列的数据已经在队伍里，那么就直接加到这个已经在队伍里的那个数据的右边，如果一个都没有，那么就将这个数据加入到队伍的末尾。

**Solution**  
队列应用，以每只队伍建立队列，再以队伍序号建立一个队列，将每个元素入到它所属的队伍队列中，若序号队列没有此队伍的序号，则将序号入队，当某个队伍队列为空时，将序号队列中的此序号出队。

```
#include
#include
#include
#include
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1000000;
int id[maxn];
bool f[1002];

int main() {

    int t, cas = 1, n, x;
    char s[20];
    while (scanf("%d",&t)!=EOF&&t!=0)
    {
        printf("Scenario #%d\n", cas++);
        queue q[1002];
        queue team;
        for (int i = 1; i 
```
